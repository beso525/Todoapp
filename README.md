#TODOAPP

TODO:

Fix Project view.
currently, I can't create projects for todos, i need the add button to also create projects.

    Then, change the sidebar view so that project titles show under "Projects" and projects is a header rather than a button.

Maybe also get rid of notes, don't really need them.

Also fix editing a todo item.
